<h1>Sponsoring GDAL/OGR </h1>  </div>
</div>
<div class="contents">
<p>Development and maintenance of GDAL/OGR is supported by organizations contracting developers, organizations contributing improvements, users contributing improvements, and volunteers. Generally speaking this works well, and GDAL/OGR has improved substantially over the years.</p>
<p>However, there are still many tasks which do not receive the attention they should. Processing bug reports, writing documentation, writing test scripts, evaluating test script failures and user support often receive less attention than would be desired. Some new features of broad interest are not implemented because they aren't important enough to any one person or organization.</p>
<p>In order to provide sustained funding to support the maintenance, improvement and promotion of the GDAL/OGR project, the project seeks project sponsors to provide financial support. Sponsorship would be accomplished via the <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Project_Sponsorship">OSGeo Project Sponsorship</a> program. Funds are held by OSGeo for disposition on behalf of the project, and dispersed at the discretion of the GDAL/OGR Project Steering Committee.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ss_uses"></a>
Sponsorship Uses</h2>
<p>The primary intended use of the sponsorship funds is to hire a maintainer on a contract basis. The responsibilities would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Addressing bug reports - reproducing then fixing or passing on to another developer. </li>
<li>
Extending, and running the test suite. </li>
<li>
Improving documentation. </li>
<li>
Other improvements to the software. </li>
<li>
General user support on the mailing list. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sponsorship funds may also be used to contract for specific improvements to GDAL, provision of resources such as web hosting, funding code sprints, or funding project promotion. Decisions on spending of sponsorship funds will be made by the GDAL/OGR Project Steering Committee.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ss_benefits"></a>

<li>

<li>

</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ss_levels"></a>
Sponsorship Process</h2>
<p>Sponsors can sponsor GDAL for any amount of money of at least $500 USD. At or above the following levels a sponsor will be designated as being one of the following class:</p>
<ol>
