GeoMap
======

Georeferencer for old maps.

Requirements for downloadable app:
  OS X Mavericks or later
  Java runtime (accidentally)
  
Requirements for building:
  Xcode6
  GDAL frameworks
  
This tool will open a scanned in image of an old map and convert it to a georeferenced version. It is designed for maps that have coordinates printed on them. Maps without coordinates would need a more extensive tool to identify ground control points on a truth map and assoicate them with points on the map image.
